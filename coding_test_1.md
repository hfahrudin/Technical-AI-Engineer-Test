- I am tying to see whether any particular city that interesting in term of number of customer for each countries. Number of customer retained on city from each country have similar characterstic spread.
- **Conclusion:** There are no cities that stand out as significantly more interesting or dominant in terms of customer numbers within each country.

This indicates that city is not a key differentiating factor for customer retention.
